You can generate SVGs from PNGS with a website I like,
if I find I will link it, try and only generate Clipart into SVGs:

w = width of svg in the HTML
h = height of svg in the HTM

viewW = The width of the svg's view port of the image, 
so, if its a 32x32 image and the viewW is 16 it would 
cut 16 pixels off the right side, starting from the orgin. 

viewH = The height of the svg's view port of the image, 
so, if its a 32x32 image and the viewH is 16 it would 
cut 16 pixels off the bottom side, starting from the orgin. 

Path data can be generated from that website
